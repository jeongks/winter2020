            <h2>WHO Statement Regarding Cluster of Pneumonia Cases in Wuhan, China</h2>
            <img src="images/article2.jpg" id="article2" alt="article">
            <p>Chinese authorities have made a preliminary determination of a novel (or new) coronavirus, identified
                in a
                hospitalized person with pneumonia in Wuhan. Chinese investigators conducted gene sequencing of the
                virus,
                using an isolate from one positive patient sample. Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a
                short
                period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new
                outbreaks.</p>
            <p>
                Initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan provided by Chinese authorities last week
                –
                including the occupation, location and symptom profile of the people affected – pointed to a
                coronavirus
                (CoV) as a possible pathogen causing this cluster. Chinese authorities subsequently reported that
                laboratory
                tests ruled out SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus and other common
                respiratory
                pathogens.</p>
            <p>
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the
                common cold,
                and others more severe disease such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person,
                while
                others do not. According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in
                some
                patients and does not transmit readily between people.</p>
            <p>
                Globally, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas, including SARS in 2002 and
                MERS in
                2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As
                surveillance improves more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.</p>
            <p>
                China has strong public health capacities and resources to respond and manage respiratory disease
                outbreaks.
                In addition to treating the patients in care and isolating new cases as they may be identified,
                public
                health officials remain focused on continued contact tracing, conducting environmental assessments
                at the
                seafood market, and investigations to identify the pathogen causing the outbreak.</p>
            <p>
                In the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and
                epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture. Further investigations are also required to
                determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented.
                WHO
                continues to monitor the situation closely and, together with its partners, is ready to provide
                technical
                support to China to investigate and respond to this outbreak.</p>
            <p>
                The preliminary determination of a novel virus will assist authorities in other countries to conduct
                disease
                detection and response. Over the past week, people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel
                history to
                Wuhan have been identified at international airports.</p>
            <p>
                WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travellers. WHO advises against the application of
                any
                travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available.</p>
